# Optimize Torch linear model

In this example, we show how to optimize torch linear model. We recommend running this example in NVIDIA NGC [PyTorch container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch). To run the example, simply run the `optimize.py` script:

```bash
./optimize.py
```
